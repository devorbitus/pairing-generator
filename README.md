# Pairing Generator
At Scholastica, we always set a few hours aside on Thursdays to [pair with another member of the team](http://blog.scholasticahq.com/post/91759651948/pairing-thursdays-how-we-keep-our-team-sharp-by). It's in the spirit of pair-programming, but all team-members get to play, whether they code or not!

This is a simple tool for randomly generating team-member pairs.
